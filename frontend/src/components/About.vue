        <h4>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER</h4>
        <p>Nice to meet you traveller! I would have shook your hand if I could. If you don't already know me I would describe myself as a curious software developer with great interest in user experience, simplicity, perfomance, sports, food and all other exciting things (switcher). I have spent most of my time building frontends in various projects.</p>
